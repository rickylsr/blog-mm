The purpose of this article is to give a quick introduction on the legal system of China to my fellow students at NUS Law. I explained to several of my friends who are not familiar with Chinese legal system. I think it is the time to write this down. I believe it is helpful for me as I have a chance to re-thinking the overall legal system of China, as well as of some help hopefully for those who are interested in this topic.
