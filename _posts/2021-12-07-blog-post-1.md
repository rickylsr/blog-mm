The purpose of this article is to give a quick introduction on the legal system of China to my fellow students at NUS Law. I have several chances to explain Chinese legal system to some of my friends orally. I think now it is the time to write those words down. 

I believe it is helpful for me as I have a chance to re-thinking the overall legal system of China. I hope that this article will be of some help for anyone who is interested.
